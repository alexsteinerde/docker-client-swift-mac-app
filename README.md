[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.4-brightgreen.svg)](http://swift.org)

This is a demo client implementation of the [Docker Client](https://github.com/alexsteinerde/docker-client-swift).

Disclaimer: This project is not a demonstration on how to use SwiftUI in the best way but instead on how it is possible to integrate the Docker client into a SwiftUI project.

## Demo
This demo project shows you how to use the `DockerClient` library and how to implement a simple Mac app that lists all available containers and images.

To use this demo, please make sure you have Docker installed and running.
